# BScThesis_ADNI
This GitHub repository contains all R-code for the BSc Thesis in Mathematics of Lana Broer, completed June 2023, at Leiden University.

The repository contains four files: 
  - 1_BScThesis_DataPrep: all data preparation steps.
  - 2_BScThesis_DescriptiveStatistics: descriptive statistics of the dataframe constructed in File 1. 
  - 3a_BScThesis_msstate_CN: model fitting for patients starting from the 'cognitively normal' state at baseline, on the study and age scale.
  - 3b_BScThesis_msstate_MCI: model fitting for patients starting from the 'mild cognitive impairment' state at baseline, on the study and age scale.

Files 2, 3a and 3b can be used only after File 1 was run. Note that File 3b cannot be run after File 3a; to run File 3b, File 1 has to be run again. 

Data used in this project is from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. More details on this project can be found on their website: https://adni.loni.usc.edu/about/.
